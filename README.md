# A Day in the Life Game

The idea for this game came from by my daily walks around my hometown. It began as a form of protest against dog owners that do not pick up their dog's shit, but it eventually evolved to include other issues in the city, such as trash in the streets and potholes on the sidewalks.

## How it was built

I didn't remeber myself coding a game before. That way I wanted to build something simple. One day, I thought of the T-Rex game from Google Chrome, that one you can play when you don't have Internet connection, and its structure was a perfect fit for what I had in mind.

## The creation process went like this

1. Watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7nIutSLvdU)
1. Got the starting [code](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/knowledge-base/tree/main/JS/games/dino-game)
1. Iterate on
   . game mechanics (actions)
   . more than one obstacle
   . sounds
   . game over
   . start screen
